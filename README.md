# CloudBits-Twitter-Counter
Counts Tweets coming in via CloudBits + IFTTT 

Written specifically for the Arduino Leonardo Board , using LittleBits :
http://littlebits.cc/bits/arduino

This will however work with most Arduino boards as a "button" counter. The button in this case, though, is connected to the Internet of Things using this IFTTT script : https://ifttt.com/recipes/339685-dockercon-test

Feel free to re-use this script, modify, and make it your own. And if you do, let me know!
